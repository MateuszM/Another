	Problem : 
	Should I add Second DB context ? 
	Is UnitOfWork and repository pattern needed  ? //need diging
	With one Db context (current default applicationDbContext) A can directly pass it to every controller , context is disposed per request. With unit of work it will be one db context.
	Maybe good for mocking?
